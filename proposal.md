## Proposed Project

I plan to create Scrabble SOS. It should be an application that allows
for people to input the letters they have into the system, which then returns
a list of possible combinations of those letters. There will probably
be multiple text boxes to hold one character each and a button to start.

## Outline Structure

I suppose the supervisor strategy will be one_for_one. There should only be one
process for this project, I think. I will send multiple lengths of letters in at
a time and find matching words. I'm pretty sure this approach will work.

Please let me know if there's anything I need to clarify and/or improve my structure.
Thank you.
